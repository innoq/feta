This repository contains a collection of common front-end tasks. Among other
things, this allows composition of a custom asset pipeline with a variety of CSS
and JavaScript preprocessors.

The idea is to pick and choose individual tasks, depending on the project - i.e.
there's no overarching framework here.

[gulp](http://gulpjs.com) is used because, while somewhat
[controversial](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2014/02/05/building-javascript-projects-with-make/),
the front-end community has largely settled on JavaScript-based build tools -
thus the ecosystem is evolving around those, rendering them almost inescapable.
